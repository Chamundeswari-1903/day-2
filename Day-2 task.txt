Difference between document and window object:
 
      The window object represents a browser window  which displays the content of the webpage, whereas the document is
a property of window object present inside of it nothing but a web page.
      By accessing the document object, we can access the element in HTML page.Also with the help of document object we 
can add  dynamic content in the form of text, picture and so on.


Document Object:

        It is the document loaded inside the browser.
        It is loaded after loading the window because the window contains a document.
        It is the root of element of the document object model(DOM).
        It is an object of window.
        we can not access window object properties inside the document.
        document.title, will return the title of the document.

Window Object:

        It is the browser window where we can see the content.
        It is loaded before the document because window contains document.
        Window is the global element for all objects, functions, etc.
        It is an object of browser.
        We can access document object properties inside the window.
        windoe.document.title, will return the title of the document.
